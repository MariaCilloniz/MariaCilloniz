# 👋 Hello World! I'm Maria 

## 🤔 Who Am I?

Think: Philosopher meets Developer. Plot twist, right? 🎭

I'm that rare breed who went from pondering Plato's Cave to debugging code caves! While philosophy taught me to question everything (like *really* everything), coding lets me actually build the solutions I dream up. It's like having the best of both worlds – deep thinking meets practical doing!
